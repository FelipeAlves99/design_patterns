# Design Patterns

This repository serves as a resource for learning various design patterns. Each project features an explanation of the problem each pattern addresses and its solution, along with examples of violations and correct implementations.

All examples are from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) 

## What it is

Design patterns are established solutions to commonly occurring software design problems that promote consistency, modularity, and flexibility, making software more maintainable, extensible, and easier to understand and debug.
